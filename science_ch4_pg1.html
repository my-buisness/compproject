In addition, all living structures are carbon based. The amount of carbon present in the earth&rsquo;s crust and in the atmosphere is quite meagre. The earth&rsquo;s crust has only 0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, hydrogencarbonates, coal and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon dioxide. In spite of this small amount of carbon available in nature, the importance of carbon seems to be immense. In this Chapter, we will know about the properties of carbon which make carbon so important to us.</span></td>
