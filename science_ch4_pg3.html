This is because an atom of oxygen has six electrons in its L shell (the atomic number of oxygen is eight) and it requires two more electrons to complete its octet. So each atom of oxygen shares two electrons with another atom of oxygen to give us the structure shown in Fig. 4.3. The two electrons contributed by each oxygen atom give rise to two shared pairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a double bond between the two atoms</span></span></td>

Does the molecule have single bonds or double bonds? What would happen in the case of a diatomic molecule of nitrogen? Nitrogen has the atomic number 7. What would be its electronic configuration and its combining capacity? In order to attain an octet, each nitrogen atom in a molecule of nitrogen contributes three electrons giving rise to three shared pairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a triple bond between the two atoms. The electron dot structure of N2 and its triple bond can be depicted as in Fig. 4.4.</span><br></td>

                                of carbon. Methane is widely used as a fuel and is a major
                                component of bio-gas and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). It
                                is also one of the simplest compounds formed by carbon.
                                Methane has a formula CH4
                                . Hydrogen, as you know, has a
                                valency of 1. Carbon is tetravalent because it has four valence
                                electrons. In order to achieve noble gas configuration, carbon
                                shares these electrons with four atoms of hydrogen as shown
                                in Fig. 4.5.

                            between two atoms are known as covalent bonds. Covalently bonded
                            molecules are seen to have strong bonds within the molecule, but intermolecular forces are weak. This gives rise to the low melting and boiling
